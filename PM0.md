### 4. Based on the project details provided in class and on the course GitHub repository, what questions do you have about the project this semester?
	Is the expected end result a design summary with implementation methods but not an actual implementation?

### 5. Provide your preliminary project idea (or set of ideas). This is not a commitment to a project. 
	We, as a team, are looking at making an issue bot that would assign work based on current work load and 
 	experience level (senior or junior). We are also looking at a design for a todo list that connects with 
  	your supervisor's email. Also requests project updates. Keeps you accountable.
